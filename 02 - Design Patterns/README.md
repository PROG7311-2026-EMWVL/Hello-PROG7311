# 🚀 Design Patterns Infographic Activity – Understanding the Three Pattern Categories

## 📝 Objective

Your task is to show your understanding of software design patterns by creating a hand-drawn infographic that explains the three categories:
* Creational Patterns
* Structural Patterns
* Behavioral Patterns

The goal is to understand what they are used for and why developers need them, not to memorise complicated definitions.

## 💡 Activity Description

You will design a poster that teaches another student design patterns in a simple way.

Your infographic must:
* Explain what each category helps with
* Show at least two examples per category
* Give a real-life comparison
* Give a programming example
* Show how the three categories differ

Note: Clear explanations matter more than neat drawings.
